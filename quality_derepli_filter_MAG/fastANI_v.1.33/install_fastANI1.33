I downloaded fastANI through the wiki:
   -> https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM/wiki/Installation#how-to-install-checkm

I wanted to analyze and make all vs all analysis of Average Nucleotide Identity. For this purpose I need to create a text file
for the query and reference MAGs, in this case both files were the same. The text file will contain the path of each MAG.

Also, I used the cherry-creek from UNLV to run this process
